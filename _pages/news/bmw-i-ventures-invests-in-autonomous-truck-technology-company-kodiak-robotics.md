<div>We are building toward a Level 4 autonomy system, but we still have a driver in the seat thats actually monitoring our system at all times, said Burnette. To date, Kodiak has publicly announced $40 million in funding from its Series A, and Burnette says the startup has had several additional investments since then. Level 4 means the vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in certain conditions without human intervention. Teslas head of AI Andrej Karpathy recently revealed the companys new supercomputer that takes a vision-only approach, but Burnette fundamentally disagrees with that method. It will also work on hiring fresh talent and expanding its truck fleet, with a stated goal of at least doubling the number of vehicles it operates each year. Our system can automatically identify that and then slow down as required by law, or nudge away from that object to give it more space.
