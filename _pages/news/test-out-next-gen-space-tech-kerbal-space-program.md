<div>Williams team designed an engine that uses the energy produced by a fusion reaction to generate thrust. In Williams engine prototype, this tokamak would be nearly sphericalmore like a donut hole. The breakthroughs and innovations that we uncover lead to new ways of thinking, new connections, and new industries.More From WIREDContact 2021 Cond Nast. Reactors filled with Americium, a highly radioactive rare material that is a byproduct of Uranium-driven nuclear reactions, generate fission products that flow down a chamber. The fission ignites the deuterium-tritium hydrogen portion of the pellet into a fusion reaction. Antimatter is a bit hard to come byits difficult to get our hands on something that literally annihilates when it comes into contact with matter. His paper came out in an era of enthusiasm for advanced propulsion, but much of that zeal has waned until recently.</div>
