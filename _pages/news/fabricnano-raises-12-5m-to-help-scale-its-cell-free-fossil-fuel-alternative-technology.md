<div>That DNA, the company hopes, will make a dent in a growing global petrochemical industry that currently relies on fossil fuels and their byproducts. It is a scalable and sustainable way to make low-value molecules, like bioplastics.Part of FabricNanos identity hinges on creating a bio-based alternative within the growing petrochemical sector. At the moment, FabricNano can already create chemicals like 1,3 propanediol, an ingredient that can be used to replace polyethylene glycol in toothpaste or shampoo. If the enzymes that stick to that DNA wafer and help produce chemicals are software, the DNA scaffold is FabricNanos hardware. Were looking to provide [manufacturers] with the technology that they can then use to manufacture at scale and at a low enough cost. Still, FabricNanos distinguishing approach probably isnt the commodity chemicals it has made so far, but the actual DNA scaffold. Biomanufacturing, simply, uses the enzymes within a cell or microbe to produce an end-product.</div>
