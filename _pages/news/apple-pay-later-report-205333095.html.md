<div>Bloomberg says it wasnt able to determine how much interest Apple plans to charge or when the company will roll out the service. The other option is to extend the payment period over multiple months, though in that case interest comes into play. If you pick the Apple Pay in 4 option, youll need to make four interest-free payments across two months. They allow you to purchase something and pay for it later by splitting up the total cost of the item into several installments. If youve done any online shopping in the last little while, theres a good chance youve run into services like Affirm and PayPals Pay in 4. By the looks of things, Apple could soon offer a similar option to Apple Pay users. Weve reached out to Apple for comment on the report, and well update this article when we hear back from the company.</div>
