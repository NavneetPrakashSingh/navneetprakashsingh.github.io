<div>We are always working on improving our ad tech products to help publishers fund their content and businesses and help advertisers efficiently reach customers. Jun 07, 2021mins readThe tools used by digital publishers and advertisers  often called ad tech  help websites and apps make money and fund high-quality content. We are also reaffirming our promise not to share any bid from any Ad Manager auction participants with any other auction participant prior to completion of the auction. Also, we are reaffirming that we will not limit Ad Manager publishers from negotiating specific terms or pricing directly with other sell-side platforms (SSPs). Ad tech also helps our advertising partners big and small reach customers and grow their businesses. While we believe we offer valuable services and compete on the merits, we are committed to working proactively with regulators everywhere to make improvements to our products. We will be testing and developing these changes over the coming months before rolling them out more broadly, including some globally.</div>
