<div>Under the new law, China wants Apple to bring that data to China and store that data on Chinese government servers. Apple is the most valuable company in the world, and it is the richest company in the world and the most profitable company in the world. Now, we dont know exactly what Apple was doing and saying to make its case to the Chinese government, and we dont know exactly how the Chinese government responded. Prior to this law, Apple stored this data largely outside of China.And this data was encrypted, which meant it could only be accessed with certain digital encryption keys. It is agreeing to import one of democracys most cherished values  economic freedom.In previous years, China and the communist government had this state-run, tightly controlled economy. How should we think about that bet now?So from an economic standpoint, Apples bet on China has been one of the biggest successes in modern business history. They are getting more access to the data of Chinas biggest internet companies like Tencent.</div>
