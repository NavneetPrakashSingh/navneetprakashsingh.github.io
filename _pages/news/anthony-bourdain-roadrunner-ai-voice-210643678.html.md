<div>Like many documentaries, the film pieces together archival footage, including interviews and show outtakes, to attempt to tell the story of its subject in their own words. In a separate interview with GQ, Neville said he contacted four different companies about the project before deciding on the best one. The film, as far as were aware, doesnt include a disclosure that AI was used to replicate Bourdains voice.

On July 16th, Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain will open in US theatres.</div>
