<div>According to a recent survey carried out by Claroty, the majority (53%) of U.S. industrial enterprises have seen an increase in cybersecurity threats since the start of 2020. With the new round of Series D funding, co-led by Bessemer and 40 North, the company has now amassed a total of $235 million. Founded in 2015, the late-stage startup focuses on the industrial side of cybersecurity. The end goal here is to be the market leader for industrial cybersecurity. The number of attacks, and impact of these attacks, is increasing significantly, especially in verticals like food, automotive, and critical infrastructure. Its customers include General Motors, Coca-Cola EuroPacific Partners and Pfizer, with Claroty helping the pharmaceutical firm to secure its COVID-19 vaccine supply chain. Additional strategic investors include LG and I Squared Capitals ISQ Global InfraTech Fund, with all previous investors  Team8, Rockwell Automation, Siemens and Schneider Electric  also participating.</div>
