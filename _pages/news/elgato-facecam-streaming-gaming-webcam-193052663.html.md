<div>The one thing missing in this list was a webcam  until todays introduction of the Elgato FaceCam.On its surface, the $200 camera is not that unique. Youll always be sharp as long as you always remain between 12 inches (30 cm) and 47 inches (120 cm) from the camera. The automatic white balance was a little warm for my taste, but it was easy enough to turn it off and knock the number down to a cooler 4000K. The FaceCam makes up for it with a robust suite of settings in its dedicated Camera Hub program. The software also comes with zoom options, but its nothing to write home about, as the camera is fixed focus. The exposure and white balance can adjust automatically, or you can tweak the settings yourself on the fly. Though its still best known for its capture cards, Elgato is working toward taking over your entire streaming setup.</div>
