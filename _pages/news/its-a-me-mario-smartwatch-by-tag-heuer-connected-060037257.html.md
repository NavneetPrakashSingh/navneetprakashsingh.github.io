<div>One of the highlights here, though, is the company's use of Mario's appearances to encourage wearers to get active and reward them when they move. Your favorite video game plumber will soon be available on a Wear OS watch. You can choose from a selection of four new watch faces, and they don't just offer red-and-blue themes. The watch's dial will become "livelier and more animated the more the wearer is active." You can access Google Assistant, get your calendar and weather updates, along with Fit progress tracking on the watch. The company says this idea was inspired by the notion of "easter eggs," so I suppose you're supposed to treat these animations as such. In addition to onscreen graphics, the watch itself has Super Mario touches.</div>
