<div>On Earth Day, April 22, SOSV published the SOSV Climate Tech 100, a list of the best startups that weve supported from their earliest stages to address climate change. The report found that only 10 firms out of 2,700 made four or more climate tech deals per year, on average, over the 2013-2019 period. There are clearly a lot of investors interested in climate tech, and most are generalists just testing the waters. In other words, who invested in the Climate Tech 100? There are always valuable insights embedded in a list like the 100.</div>
