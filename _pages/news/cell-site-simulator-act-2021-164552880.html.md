<div>For instance, it would leave the door open for law enforcement to use the devices in contexts like bomb threats where an IMSI catcher can prevent a remote detonation. More commonly known as Stingrays, police frequently use IMSI catchers and cell-site simulators to collect information on suspects and intercept calls, SMS messages and other forms of communication. Law enforcement agencies in the US currently do not require a warrant to use the technology. It also details exceptions where police could use the technology without a warrant. The reason for this is that while IMSI catchers act like a cell tower, they don't function as one, and they can't transfer calls to a public wireless network. The Cell-Site Simulator Act of 2021 seeks to change that.IMSI catchers mimic cell towers to trick mobile phones into connecting with them. They would also need to explain why other surveillance methods wouldn't be as effective.</div>
