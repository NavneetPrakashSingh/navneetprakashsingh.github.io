<div>However, until recently, the technology has fallen short in practice.Solid-state batteries have significantly higher energy density and are potentially safer because they do not use flammable liquid electrolytes. The global economys transition to widespread electrification has increased the demand for longer-lasting and faster-charging batteries across industries including transportation, consumer electronics, medical devices and residential energy storage. The batteries made by Sila Nanotechnologies are an illustrative example of using a silicon mix to increase energy density. That instability leads to delamination (a mode of failure where a material fractures into layers), cracks and separation  all of which cause premature battery failure. However, a thicker cathode would reduce the mechanical and thermal stability of the battery. The obvious solution to this dilemma would be to have batteries with thicker cathodes. However, the technology is still nascent and has a long way to go to achieve commercialization.</div>
