Musk has a long history of over promising and under delivering when it comes to his companys so-called Full Self-Driving software. Meanwhile, AV companies like Waymo have real driverless vehicles on public roads giving rides to passengers. Haha, FSD 9 beta is shipping soon, I swear!Generalized self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI. He did it in 2018, when he promised that the long awaited V9 (Version 9) would begin rolling out in August. To which the entire engineering community rose up as one to say, No duh.Or at least thats how it should have happened in a just world.
