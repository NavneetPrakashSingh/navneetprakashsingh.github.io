<div>For example, autonomous truck company Kodiak Robotics, which last week announced an investment from BMW i Ventures, was a part of this fund. The firm has already made its first investment out of the new fund with U.K.-based Motorway, a used car marketplace. The firm doesnt operate as a traditional corporate venture capital fund, but rather acts independently from BMW while being fully backed by the German automaker. In some cases its just making them aware that this new technology exists and might be coming your way, said Sage. Fund I focused more on autonomous and digital vehicle technology, customer experience and advanced production. We have two goals right now, so the first is the financial goal and thats our most important driver, Kasper Sage, managing partner at BMW i Ventures, told TechCrunch. We are introducing them and will bring them into the company, they will be talking to the right engineers.</div>
