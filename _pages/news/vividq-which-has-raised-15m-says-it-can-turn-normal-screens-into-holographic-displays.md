<div>VividQ, a UK-based deeptech startup with technology for rendering holograms on legacy screens, has raised $15 million to develop its technology for next-generation digital displays and devices. At VividQ, we are on a mission to bring holographic displays to the world for the first time. We dont use any optical trickery.When we say holograms, what we mean is a hologram is essentially an instruction set that tells light how to behave. The demand for improved 3D images in real-world settings is growing across the whole display industry. We compute that effect algorithmically and then present that to the eye, so its indistinguishable from a real object. So you know the image is actually extending out of the screen. Its entirely natural as well.</div>
