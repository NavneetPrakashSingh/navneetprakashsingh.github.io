The global economys transition to widespread electrification has increased the demand for longer-lasting and faster-charging batteries across industries including transportation, consumer electronics, medical devices and residential energy storage. The batteries made by Sila Nanotechnologies are an illustrative example of using a silicon mix to increase energy density. That instability leads to delamination (a mode of failure where a material fractures into layers), cracks and separation  all of which cause premature battery failure. However, a thicker cathode would reduce the mechanical and thermal stability of the battery. The obvious solution to this dilemma would be to have batteries with thicker cathodes. However, the technology is still nascent and has a long way to go to achieve commercialization."},{"source":{"id":"wired","name":"Wired"},"author":"Tyler Hayes","title":"Want to Write Better?

More commonly known as Stingrays, police frequently use IMSI catchers and cell-site simulators to collect information on suspects and intercept calls, SMS messages and other forms of communication. Law enforcement agencies in the US currently do not require a warrant to use the technology. It also details exceptions where police could use the technology without a warrant. The reason for this is that while IMSI catchers act like a cell tower, they don't function as one, and they can't transfer calls to a public wireless network. The Cell-Site Simulator Act of 2021 seeks to change that.IMSI catchers mimic cell towers to trick mobile phones into connecting with them.

The global economys transition to widespread electrification has increased the demand for longer-lasting and faster-charging batteries across industries including transportation, consumer electronics, medical devices and residential energy storage. The batteries made by Sila Nanotechnologies are an illustrative example of using a silicon mix to increase energy density. That instability leads to delamination (a mode of failure where a material fractures into layers), cracks and separation  all of which cause premature battery failure. However, a thicker cathode would reduce the mechanical and thermal stability of the battery. The obvious solution to this dilemma would be to have batteries with thicker cathodes. However, the technology is still nascent and has a long way to go to achieve commercialization."},{"source":{"id":"wired","name":"Wired"},"author":"Tyler Hayes","title":"Want to Write Better?

Law enforcement agencies in the US currently do not require a warrant to use the technology. It also details exceptions where police could use the technology without a warrant.
