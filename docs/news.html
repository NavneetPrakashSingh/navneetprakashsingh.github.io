The global economys transition to widespread electrification has increased the demand for longer-lasting and faster-charging batteries across industries including transportation, consumer electronics, medical devices and residential energy storage. The batteries made by Sila Nanotechnologies are an illustrative example of using a silicon mix to increase energy density. That instability leads to delamination (a mode of failure where a material fractures into layers), cracks and separation  all of which cause premature battery failure. However, a thicker cathode would reduce the mechanical and thermal stability of the battery. The obvious solution to this dilemma would be to have batteries with thicker cathodes. However, the technology is still nascent and has a long way to go to achieve commercialization."},{"source":{"id":"wired","name":"Wired"},"author":"Tyler Hayes","title":"Want to Write Better?

More commonly known as Stingrays, police frequently use IMSI catchers and cell-site simulators to collect information on suspects and intercept calls, SMS messages and other forms of communication. Law enforcement agencies in the US currently do not require a warrant to use the technology. It also details exceptions where police could use the technology without a warrant. The reason for this is that while IMSI catchers act like a cell tower, they don't function as one, and they can't transfer calls to a public wireless network. The Cell-Site Simulator Act of 2021 seeks to change that.IMSI catchers mimic cell towers to trick mobile phones into connecting with them. They would also need to explain why other surveillance methods wouldn't be as effective."},{"source":{"id":"techcrunch","name":"TechCrunch"},"author":"Rebecca Bellan","title":"Nvidia acquires hi-def mapping startup DeepMap to bolster AV technology","description":"Chipmaker Nvidia is acquiring DeepMap, the high-definition mapping startup announced.

The global economys transition to widespread electrification has increased the demand for longer-lasting and faster-charging batteries across industries including transportation, consumer electronics, medical devices and residential energy storage. The batteries made by Sila Nanotechnologies are an illustrative example of using a silicon mix to increase energy density. That instability leads to delamination (a mode of failure where a material fractures into layers), cracks and separation  all of which cause premature battery failure.

The default plate that surrounds the USB-C plug fits iPads without screen protectors, but theres an included plate that accommodates screen protectors. If you need something a bit more durable (and dont want to spend $300), Zaggs $30 Slim Book Go could do the trick. Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus nib over a glass surface feels nothing like normal writing.
