  summary: 'The Security Service of Ukraine or SBU has discovered and raided a cryptocurrency
    mining farm that allegedly stole electricity from the country''s power grid. Apparently,
    the operators used special electricity meters to prevent authorities from discovering
    the theft, which amounted to as much as US$257,000. Vinnytsiaoblenergo denied
    any involvement in a statement sent to the Kyiv Post: "The equipment used for
    cryptocurrency mining has never operated on premises owned by our enterprise."
    It''s the largest cryptofarm the SBU has discovered so far, and the agency believes
    it''s being operated by people living in the cities of Kyiv and Vinnytsia. But
    instead of findings computers, the agency found racks with thousands of PS4 Pros
    stacked vertically side-by-side. It also said that it didn''t find any evidence
    of electric theft and that the SBU''s findings "does not correspond to reality."
    As Kotaku notes, 3,800 consoles mean an investment of around US$1,500,000, assuming
    all of them are PS4 Pros.Please enter a valid email address'

  summary: It's updating its free Call Filter app with a "Neighborhood Filter" that
    blocks calls from numbers that share your area code and prefix. A simple filter
    could lead to far fewer annoyances, not to mention greater trust in those calls
    that do come in.Verizon owns Engadget's parent company, Verizon Media. This kind
    of spamming is frequent, to the point where you might get multiple calls per day.
    Neighborhood filtering isn't the most sophisticated defense against scam calls,
    but it's arguably overdue. Verizon (currently Engadget's parent company) might
    have a solution. Engadget remains editorially independent.Please enter a valid

  summary: The retailer has discounted the laptop by $80, marking one of the first
    times weve seen it on sale since it came out earlier in the year. The display
    on the Spin 713 is also bright and sharp with a pixel density of 200 pixels per
    inch. The taller screen also means you get a more generous trackpad than youll
    find on your average Chromebook. Combine that with a solid keyboard, a capable
    processor and just the right amount of RAM for Chrome OS and you have a device
    thats solid. Part of what makes it stand out in the crowded Chrome OS market is
    that it features a display with a 3:2 aspect ratio. Most Chromebooks feature 16:9
    displays, making them well-suited for watching video content but less than ideal
    if you need to do any work on them. Aside from average battery life, one of the
    few complaints we had with the Spin 713 was the asking price.

  summary: While the US and other parts of the world have barred it from their national
    5G networks, the Chinese company is ideally situated to make money on licensing
    fees. Huawei and Verizon (Engadgets parent company) have settled their long-standing
    patent dispute. The disagreement dates back to 2019 when Huawei said it approached
    Verizon about licensing some of its technologies. Verizon is happy with the settlement
    reached with Huawei involving patent lawsuits. At the time, Verizon dismissed
    the lawsuits, claiming they were nothing more than a PR stunt.It has since changed
    its tune. It has among the most 5G-related standards-relevant patents of any company
    in the world. At the center of the feud were 12 standards-relevant patents that
    Huawei said Verizon was using in its infrastructure.

  summary: Virgin Galactic is aimed primarily at space tourists content with suborbital

    can't justify expensive conventional rockets. This isn't to say the two execs
    will start feuding if their businesses truly overlap  just don't count on the
    positive vibes lasting forever.Big day ahead. SpaceX, meanwhile, has focused its
    tourism efforts on lunar flybys and usually carries costlier payloads into space.
    It's not certain just where the SpaceX founder is in the queue, but it's safe
    to say his ride will garner some attention.The feeling is mutual. Feeling good,
    feeling excited, feeling ready. He even went so far as to tweet a photo showing
    him and Musk together.Just don't expect that kind of warmth and camaraderie from
    Jeff Bezos. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Branson said Musk was a "friend"
    and suggested he might fly on a SpaceX ship "one day."
