  summary: Over the past year, Twitter introduced some changes that made it easier
    to choose how to reply to tweets and to manage who can reply to your tweets. That
    rollout gave you the ability to choose who can reply to you  everyone, people
    you follow or people you mention  before you send out your tweet. All you need
    to do is tap on the ellipsis button at the top right corner of your post and choose
    the option that says "Change who can reply. Now, it's adding a new feature that
    gives you a way to make sure your reply section is clean and friendly. The social
    network now lets you change who can reply to your tweets even after you've already
    sent it out. The new feature is likely part of the platform's efforts to "increase
    the health of public conversation," which Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey previously said
    is his company's singular objective. https://t.co/rNWJk6zWTr pic.twitter.com/3HFSjAotg7In
    August last year, the company took its reply-limiting feature out of the experimental
    phase and gave all uses access to it.

    devices to double as point of sale terminals that can process NFC payments. 5G
    will enable the small and medium business to handle transactions more quickly
    and focus on what they are really delivering to customers, Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg
    told CNBC. One of the main areas they plan to work on is contactless payments.
    The companies told CNBC they hope their new partnership starts producing results
    by 2023. It spent $45.4 billion, more than AT&T and T-Mobile combined, in the
    recent Federal Communications Commissions C-band auction to secure as mid-band
    spectrum as possible.

  title: Apple is reportedly working on a pay later feature for Apple Pay | Engadget

    a service called “Apple Pay Later” that will allow those with its devices to settle

  summary: Bloomberg says it wasnt able to determine how much interest Apple plans
    to charge or when the company will roll out the service. The other option is to
    extend the payment period over multiple months, though in that case interest comes
    into play. If you pick the Apple Pay in 4 option, youll need to make four interest-free
    payments across two months. They allow you to purchase something and pay for it
    later by splitting up the total cost of the item into several installments. If
    youve done any online shopping in the last little while, theres a good chance
    youve run into services like Affirm and PayPals Pay in 4. By the looks of things,
    Apple could soon offer a similar option to Apple Pay users. Weve reached out to
    Apple for comment on the report, and well update this article when we hear back
    from the company.

    harder, going even higher, and takes a tour around the perimeter of the stage.

    (and turning my head) in that direction, like how you control the direction of
    your snowboard. Blades of grass fly around, the engines roaring so loud that its
    hard for the audience to choose between Instagramming this spectacle or plugging
    their ears with their fingers. Tapping into enthusiastic early adopters does offer
    the funding needed to evolve these projects, and fuel is expensive  so are these
    jetsuits.

  page_url: "/its-a-me-mario-smartwatch-by-tag-heuer-connected-060037257.html"
  summary: One of the highlights here, though, is the company's use of Mario's appearances
    to encourage wearers to get active and reward them when they move. Your favorite
    video game plumber will soon be available on a Wear OS watch. You can choose from
    a selection of four new watch faces, and they don't just offer red-and-blue themes.
    The watch's dial will become "livelier and more animated the more the wearer is
    active." You can access Google Assistant, get your calendar and weather updates,
    along with Fit progress tracking on the watch. The company says this idea was
    inspired by the notion of "easter eggs," so I suppose you're supposed to treat
    these animations as such. In addition to onscreen graphics, the watch itself has
    Super Mario touches.
