    own words. In a separate interview with GQ, Neville said he contacted four different
    companies about the project before deciding on the best one. The film, as far
    as were aware, doesnt include a disclosure that AI was used to replicate Bourdains
    voice. I created an AI model of his voice, he told the magazine.It appears that
    was no easy feat either. That company fed about a dozen hours of audio to an AI
    model. On July 16th, Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain will open in US

  summary: The one thing missing in this list was a webcam  until todays introduction
    of the Elgato FaceCam.On its surface, the $200 camera is not that unique. Youll
    always be sharp as long as you always remain between 12 inches (30 cm) and 47
    inches (120 cm) from the camera. The automatic white balance was a little warm
    for my taste, but it was easy enough to turn it off and knock the number down
    to a cooler 4000K. The FaceCam makes up for it with a robust suite of settings
    in its dedicated Camera Hub program. The software also comes with zoom options,
    but its nothing to write home about, as the camera is fixed focus. The exposure
    and white balance can adjust automatically, or you can tweak the settings yourself
    on the fly. Though its still best known for its capture cards, Elgato is working
    toward taking over your entire streaming setup.
