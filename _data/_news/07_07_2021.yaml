  summary: However, until recently, the technology has fallen short in practice.Solid-state
    batteries have significantly higher energy density and are potentially safer because
    they do not use flammable liquid electrolytes. The global economys transition
    to widespread electrification has increased the demand for longer-lasting and
    faster-charging batteries across industries including transportation, consumer
    electronics, medical devices and residential energy storage. The batteries made
    by Sila Nanotechnologies are an illustrative example of using a silicon mix to
    increase energy density. That instability leads to delamination (a mode of failure
    where a material fractures into layers), cracks and separation  all of which cause
    premature battery failure. However, a thicker cathode would reduce the mechanical
    and thermal stability of the battery. The obvious solution to this dilemma would
    be to have batteries with thicker cathodes. However, the technology is still nascent
    and has a long way to go to achieve commercialization.

  summary: You poured effort into a story you want to convince people to read, so
    get creative.If you track your work, you should also document it. You can also
    use a service like CrowdTangle to see how your work is being shared on social
    media. Writing may not be easy, but it doesnt need to be impossible either.Did
    you know spellcheck was once a benchmark used to measure how speedy a computer
    could run? This can also help freelancers find new publications they might be
    able to work with in the future. This includes things like learning how to better
    edit myself to finding who has shared my published work later on. Its grammar
    and spell checking can also burn you.To avoid missing mistakes, dont rely on a
    single writing tool. Chances are good that people are talking about your work
    but not mentioning you directly.Search Google for links and article titles too.

  title: US lawmakers want to restrict police use of 'Stingray' cell tower simulators
  description: Law enforcement agencies in the US currently do not require a warrant
    to use the technology. The Cell-Site Simulator Act of 2021 seeks to change that.

  page_url: "/cell-site-simulator-act-2021-164552880.html"
  summary: For instance, it would leave the door open for law enforcement to use the
    devices in contexts like bomb threats where an IMSI catcher can prevent a remote
    detonation. More commonly known as Stingrays, police frequently use IMSI catchers
    and cell-site simulators to collect information on suspects and intercept calls,
    SMS messages and other forms of communication. Law enforcement agencies in the
    US currently do not require a warrant to use the technology. It also details exceptions
    where police could use the technology without a warrant. The reason for this is
    that while IMSI catchers act like a cell tower, they don't function as one, and
    they can't transfer calls to a public wireless network. The Cell-Site Simulator
    Act of 2021 seeks to change that.IMSI catchers mimic cell towers to trick mobile
    phones into connecting with them. They would also need to explain why other surveillance
    methods wouldn't be as effective.

  page_url: "/ai-pioneer-raquel-urtasun-launches-self-driving-vehicle-startup-with-backing-from-khosla-uber-and-aurora"
  summary: However, the traditional approach limits the power of AI, Urtasun said,
    adding that developers must manually tune the software stack, a complex and time-consuming
    task. It is also difficult to incorporate any prior knowledge about the task that
    the developer is trying to solve, like, oh, driving for instance. Beyond those
    basics are a variety of approaches, including within AI.Most self-driving vehicle
    developers use a traditional form of AI. Urtasun, who is the sole founder and
    CEO, already has a long list of high-profile backers, including separate investments
    from Uber and Aurora. That is a problem for any self-driving startup that wants
    to be able verify and validate its system. However, the simulator will allow the
    company to rely less on this form of testing. We can even prepare for new geographies
    before we drive there, Urtasun said.

  summary: VividQ, a UK-based deeptech startup with technology for rendering holograms
    on legacy screens, has raised $15 million to develop its technology for next-generation
    digital displays and devices. At VividQ, we are on a mission to bring holographic
    displays to the world for the first time. We dont use any optical trickery.When
    we say holograms, what we mean is a hologram is essentially an instruction set
    that tells light how to behave. The demand for improved 3D images in real-world
    settings is growing across the whole display industry. We compute that effect
    algorithmically and then present that to the eye, so its indistinguishable from
    a real object. So you know the image is actually extending out of the screen.
    Its entirely natural as well.

  summary: We are building toward a Level 4 autonomy system, but we still have a driver
    in the seat thats actually monitoring our system at all times, said Burnette.
    To date, Kodiak has publicly announced $40 million in funding from its Series
    A, and Burnette says the startup has had several additional investments since
    then. Level 4 means the vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in certain conditions
    without human intervention. Teslas head of AI Andrej Karpathy recently revealed
    the companys new supercomputer that takes a vision-only approach, but Burnette
    fundamentally disagrees with that method. It will also work on hiring fresh talent
    and expanding its truck fleet, with a stated goal of at least doubling the number
    of vehicles it operates each year. Our system can automatically identify that
    and then slow down as required by law, or nudge away from that object to give
    it more space. BMWs Silicon Valley-based venture capital arm is investing in Kodiak

  summary: That DNA, the company hopes, will make a dent in a growing global petrochemical
    industry that currently relies on fossil fuels and their byproducts. It is a scalable
    and sustainable way to make low-value molecules, like bioplastics.Part of FabricNanos
    identity hinges on creating a bio-based alternative within the growing petrochemical
    sector. At the moment, FabricNano can already create chemicals like 1,3 propanediol,
    an ingredient that can be used to replace polyethylene glycol in toothpaste or
    shampoo. If the enzymes that stick to that DNA wafer and help produce chemicals
    are software, the DNA scaffold is FabricNanos hardware. Were looking to provide
    [manufacturers] with the technology that they can then use to manufacture at scale
    and at a low enough cost. Still, FabricNanos distinguishing approach probably
    isnt the commodity chemicals it has made so far, but the actual DNA scaffold.
    Biomanufacturing, simply, uses the enzymes within a cell or microbe to produce
    an end-product.

    drivers. Congress must push the industry to move quickly to protect lives before
    profits and stand behind their products when things inevitably go wrong. No one
    should forget that the Ford Pinto met all the minimum standards when it was recalled
    for exploding upon impact when hit from behind. Some are well known, like Kevin

  summary: Under the new law, China wants Apple to bring that data to China and store
    that data on Chinese government servers. Apple is the most valuable company in
    the world, and it is the richest company in the world and the most profitable
    company in the world. Now, we dont know exactly what Apple was doing and saying
    to make its case to the Chinese government, and we dont know exactly how the Chinese
    government responded. Prior to this law, Apple stored this data largely outside
    of China.And this data was encrypted, which meant it could only be accessed with
    certain digital encryption keys. It is agreeing to import one of democracys most
    cherished values  economic freedom.In previous years, China and the communist
    government had this state-run, tightly controlled economy. How should we think
    about that bet now?So from an economic standpoint, Apples bet on China has been
    one of the biggest successes in modern business history. They are getting more
    access to the data of Chinas biggest internet companies like Tencent.

  summary: Theres sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and weak supply due
    to the reopening of the economy and various factors. Still, some senior executives
    have worried about pushback from employees.This month, Goldman Sachs said its
    employees in the United States would have to report their vaccination status.
    (The retail workers union is challenging the results of the election at the Bessemer
    warehouse, accusing Amazon of intimidating workers. Powell added that price jumps
    have been bigger than expected and that the Fed was monitoring them closely, but
    he said they were still expected to wane over time. These things hold us back
    as an economy and as a country.The Fed cannot solve issues of economic inequality
    itself, he said. Lumber prices in the futures market, for example, are down more
    than 45 percent from their peak, slipping below $1,000 for the first time in months.
    They dont speak to a broadly tight economy into the kind of thing that has led
    to high inflation over time.

  summary: 'Rembrandt painted them this way to create a sense of movement through
    the canvas.Once the new pieces were restored, so was the balance, Dibbits said.
    The original was asymmetrical: The large arch that stands behind the crowd was
    in the middle, and the groups leaders were on the right. About two feet from the
    left of the canvas was shaved off, and another nine inches from the top. It was
    useful as a model for the missing pieces, even if Lundenss style was nowhere near
    as detailed as Rembrandts. The figure looks suspiciously like the artist.Thats
    so like Rembrandt, Dibbits said. The snipped pieces were lost. AdvertisementSupported
