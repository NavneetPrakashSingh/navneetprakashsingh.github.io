  summary: The Information first reported that the company was seeking to hire an
    executive who'd oversee its expansion into video games back in May. Netflix isn't
    exactly inexperienced in the area and previously developed games based on its
    popular shows. Verdu was the VP of augmented and virtual reality games and content
    at Facebook, where he worked with developers for the Oculus Rift, Quest and Go.
    Adding video games to its repertoire seems to be the answer it came up with recently.
    Back then, a company spokesperson told The Information:"Our members value the
    variety and quality of our content. According to Bloomberg, the company has hired
    Mike Verdu, a former Oculus and EA exec, as vice president of game development.
    Netflix may be a TV show, movie and game streaming platform in the near future.

  summary: And even though a tool like Azure Virtual Desktop brought it to the cloud
    (Manchester assures us that's not going anywhere either), it's even more difficult
    to manage. Now, instead of managing local Windows installations on pricey notebooks,
    IT folks can get by with simpler hardware that taps into a scalable cloud. (Microsoft
    is also using technology that can render streaming video on a local machine, which
    it eventually passes over to your Cloud PC.) You just need to head to Windows365.com
    when it launches on August 2nd (that domain isn't yet live), choose a virtual
    machine configuration, and you'll be up and running. (Unfortunately, we don't
    yet know how much the service is going to cost, but Microsoft says it will reveal
    final pricing on August 1st. Manchester tells us that Microsoft noticed a whopping
    80 percent of AVD customers were relying on third-party vendors to help manage
    their installations. )Windows 365 likely isn't going to mean much for most consumers,
    but it could be life-changing for IT departments and small businesses.

  summary: In addition, you'll also get one-click access to controls including Reload
    and Sharing, as well as access to new features like Tab Groups from the toolbar.
    Safari is getting some design updates, including easier access to reloading, sharing
    and Tab Groups in macOS Monterey, as well as improved navigation features in iOS
    15. With today's beta release, though, Apple's brought back the standalone Tab
    bar, which will be enabled by default, like it was on Big Sur. One of the changes
    in the macOS Monterey beta that we didn't like was the removal of the tabs bar.
    If you can't wait a bit longer for the stable release, make sure you back up your
    data before installing the updates. Apple also added a Reload option to the long-press
    menu on the left side of the tab bar. But be warned, you'll need to be sure you
    want to risk running potentially unstable software.

  page_url: "/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html"
  summary: I also like the extra flap Otterbox added that keeps the screen cover closed
    and holds the second-generation Apple Pencil to the side of the iPad Pros. Matte
    screen protectors can get closer to replicating the pen-on-paper experience, and
    they also prevent the stylus nib from wearing down so quickly. The default plate
    that surrounds the USB-C plug fits iPads without screen protectors, but theres
    an included plate that accommodates screen protectors. If you need something a
    bit more durable (and dont want to spend $300), Zaggs $30 Slim Book Go could do
    the trick. Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus
    nib over a glass surface feels nothing like normal writing. I also like that its
    wipeable fabric prevents spills and dirt from getting inside the keyboard. Were
    fans of Samsungs T7 series and SanDisks Extreme drives for those that want a good
    amount of extra storage in a fairly durable yet pocketable gadget.

  summary: The company recently launched an "Athena" satellite through its PointView
    Tech subsidiary, but it was only a test mission rather than the start of a satellite
    internet constellation. The race to develop satellite internet includes some pretty
    big players like SpaceX, Amazon, Softbank and Facebook. However, Facebook has
    now essentially thrown in the towel in that business, selling its internet satellite
    team to Amazon, The Information has reported. It also announced last year that
    it would use United Launch Alliance's ultra-reliable Atlas V rocket for the initial
    satellite launches. With the sale of its satellite team to Amazon, it appears
    that any ambitions it may have had in that area are over. The employees coming
    from Facebook are reportedly based in the Los Angeles area and include physicists
    as well as optical, prototyping, mechanical and software engineers. It also plans
    to build 12 ground stations around the world to transmit data to and from the
    satellites.
