  summary: The first, the weekly series Thank Your Ass Off, debuts through the platform
    on July 12th at 11AM Eastern.The arrangement lets TED sell ads and sponsorships
    for its conversations. The TED pact reclaims some of that ground, even if the
    audience doesn't entirely dovetail with that for American football.Please enter
    a valid email address The Verge notes that TED has struck a deal to offer exclusive
    drop-in audio chats to Clubhouse. Clubhouse's NFL deal lost some of its thunder
    in light of the league's Twitter Spaces chats. It could be a while before in-person
    TED talks resume in earnest, but you're about to get an alternative of sorts.
    It's also a shrewd move to keep Clubhouse relevant in the face of stiffer competition.
    Clubhouse won't take a share, either.

    a valid email address Taiwan has largely kept COVID-19 levels low throughout the
    pandemic, but new cases started surging in late April and prompted rare restrictions
    on the island. The two are purchasing the shots from Fosun Pharmaceutical after
    China allegedly "spiked" Taiwan's bid to directly buy the vaccine.There was pressure
    to make a deal. Outbreaks could hurt their operations, even for those factories
    and other facilities beyond Taiwan.

  summary: Now that Virgin Galactic has flown its founder to the edge of space, it's
    ready to give everyday people a chance at a similar trip. Virgin and Omaze have
    announced a sweepstakes that lets you win two seats aboard "one of the first"
    commercial spaceflights. Just be ready to take some time off from work if you
    do win. All the same, it's a significant moment for private spaceflight. You'll
    have to go through the same training as any other Virgin Galactic passenger.

    mentioning Premier Access numbers after months of staying quiet.

  summary: The technology uses machine learning to produce animations in real time,
    leading to more "organic" movement. However, it is clear that the gaming giant
    wants to offer a strong incentive to play on newer machines. EA isn't just giving
    Madden NFL players an upgrade if they play on next-gen consoles. A FIFA 22 Legacy
    Edition is coming to the Nintendo Switch, although EA didn't outline differences.Thankfully,
    there are other substantial changes regardless of what platform you use. That's
    not surprising given both the larger player base and shortages that limit the
    number of PS5 and Xbox Series owners. Don't be surprised if FIFA 23 cuts off PS4
    and Xbox One players.Please enter a valid email address

  page_url: "/copy-of-volvos-c-40-recharge-is-a-solid-second-stab-at-an-ev-163057572.html"
  summary: The C40 Recharge can also accept power from Level 2 (220V) sources, requiring
    around 8 hours to fully charge. For example the Model Y Long Range starts from
    $52,490 and gets a 100 miles-plus more distance using an equivalently sized battery
    pack. The company plans to release a new electric model every year until 2025
    as part of its larger goal of becoming completely carbon neutral by 2040. Youll
    be able to control the stereo, make calls, send texts, adjust the climate controls
    and even turn on the heated steering wheel. It's a very practical, sustainable
    solution, trying to get us away from traditional luxuries, Volvos design rep told
    Engadget. While I personally am a fan of tactile controls, C40 drivers wont have
    a whole much use for them on account of the ever-present Android Assistant. The
    Audi Q4 e-tron on the other hand manages to achieve the same range on a surprisingly
    tiny 52 kWh pack.

  summary: The company is throwing in six months free with every purchase, and that
    gets you additional insight like your activity, heart rate and sleep trends. If
    I asked you to envision a fitness tracker on a random persons wrist, what would
    your imaginary wearable look like? Thats far less information than youll see at
    a glance on a bigger screen, but thats the sacrifice you make for a smaller tracker.
    But its size is also one of its drawbacks  its tiny screen makes things hard to
    read. The fact that this little device can do so much is noteworthy, and those
    with smaller wrists will like the way it fits. Instant style elevation.Thats nice,
    but you could make most other fitness trackers look attractive by swapping in
    a pretty band. Thats it.For more customization, like rearranging your favorite
    workouts in Exercise, youll need to go to the Fitbit app on your phone.

  page_url: "/biden-executive-order-call-for-reinstating-net-neutrality-141029471.html"
  summary: Similar notions of price transparency, consumer rights, increased scrutiny
    of mergers and prevention of excessive fees were prevalent across the other industries
    covered. The order contains 72 proposals and actions, among which it specifically
    says "the President encourages the FCC to restore Net Neutrality rules undone
    by the prior administration." In other industries, like banking and personal finance,
    the order similarly asked for more robust scrutiny of mergers. It also asked the
    agency to consider limiting early termination fees and prevent internet service
    providers from making deals with landlords that limit tenant choices. It also
    urged the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to "issue rules allowing
    customers to download their banking data and take it with them." Under agriculture,
    for example, the order also highlighted the need to give consumers the right to
    repair their tractors and equipment. In other words, it's targeting anticompetitive
    practices across a wide range of industries, including internet services and tech.

  page_url: "/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-140057578.html"
  summary: 'Rather than cram the glasses full of tech, TCL put two displays, a pair
    of speakers and positioning hardware inside. Let me ask you a question: Do you
    really want to buy a pair of Personal Cinema glasses? The idea is to keep the
    screens in line with your eyes, but the unfortunate result is that you need to
    put the nose pads way down your nose. As I said, its possible to work with these
    on, and it would make sense to use them if you had to view sensitive documents.
    I got a full view of the screen and it was significantly more comfortable to wear
    for longer periods of time. And TCL deserves a fair crack at making these things
    cheaper and a little less prone to pinching, because were so damn close. The Nxtwear
    G Wearable Display Glasses solve many of the problems that dogged those earlier
    attempts.'
