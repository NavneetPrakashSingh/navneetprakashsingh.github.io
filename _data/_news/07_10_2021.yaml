  summary: According to the report, Europe isnt doing enough to foster more deep tech
    startups and investors. Its a long process that requires continuous investments
    that start from the bottom of the tech stack and moves upward.12 Paris-based VCs
    look at the state of their city Investors as well as startup employees who hold
    stock options will be quite pleased to see that itll be easier to make money quickly.
    (Im personally not convinced there will be more European tech giants if we incentivize
    acquisitions with tax breaks. Some countries already have a tech worker visa.
    And yet, building a tech giant is a complicated task. In particular, the group
    thinks Europe is still lagging behind when it comes to late-stage investments.

  summary: We gave it a score of 83 for its simple design, tap-to-snooze feature,
    built-in nightlight and good smart home controls. Hisense makes solid budget sets
    that are good options for college students who want a full-featured smart TV without
    spending a ton of money. It's free to sign up for My Best Buy and it's worth it
    to get a bit of extra money off all of the retailer's current sales. The evolution
    of Prime Day over the years has spawned competing sale events from Amazon's biggest
    competitors like Walmart, Target and Best Buy. It includes an 80-inch white and
    color strip plus the power adapter and a connector box for reattaching cut pieces.
    We liked its speedier performance, clearer and louder audio and its subtle, pleasant
    design. While not an all-time low, it's still a good sale on a much improved Chromebook.

  summary: Far from shrinking the budget, the Biden team must raise it even more.One
    complication is the rural-urban divide within the digital divide. The harsh reality
    is that the digital divide mirrors a racial divide, with cities such as Detroit,
    Philadelphia, and Cleveland as prime case studies. On the surface, it would appear
    that bridging the digital divide is a bipartisan priority, again partly due to
    a shared incentive to win over rural voters. Besides the fights over how much,
    more disagreements lurk over the how. The Biden plan envisions internet access
    as a utility with municipal and other public solutions. However, three times as
    many urban households as rural households lack broadband subscriptions. Both Democrat
    and Republican proposals emphasize lack of internet access in rural areas, where
    theyre keen to pick up voters. Residents of the poorest zip code in Shelby County,
    Tennessee, could not sign up for vaccines because 70 percent of them lack internet
    access.

  summary: On Earth Day, April 22, SOSV published the SOSV Climate Tech 100, a list
    of the best startups that weve supported from their earliest stages to address
    climate change. The report found that only 10 firms out of 2,700 made four or
    more climate tech deals per year, on average, over the 2013-2019 period. There
    are clearly a lot of investors interested in climate tech, and most are generalists
    just testing the waters. In other words, who invested in the Climate Tech 100?
    There are always valuable insights embedded in a list like the 100.
