<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
So, you have finally choosen to jumpstart your learning related to Data Science, I will try to smoothen the bumpy ride of data science's terms, concepts and idealogy and try to break it into simplest form as possible. Before we start to embark our journey in the world of data science, lets just break the work data science. What does it actually mean? So, data science is composed of two words Data and Science but it's more commonly called data driven science which involves scientific methods, processes and systems to extract useful knowledge from existing data. Does the term seem similar to you? Yeah its very similar to data mining. Okay so if its similar to data mining, whats the difference between data mining and data science. Well we'll have a discussion about that some other day in some other post, but what you must know is data science is a great way to empower yourself involving statistics, software and the most important thing, your attention. So strap your seatbelts because its going to be a fun ride learning data science.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>TOOLS REQUIRED</strong>
anaconda cloud, python, spyder. Within the next tutorial we'll show how to install python along with spyder</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>APPLICATIONS</strong>
Facial recognization used by facebook involves machine learning algorithms
xbox connect uses machine learning algorithms which tracts your movements as and when you play
virtual reality headsets tracks your movements again using machine learning algorithms
voice reognization, text to speech used in your phones involves ml algorithms
robot dogs learning how to walk using reinforcement learning
facebok ads again using machine learning algorithm
amazon, audible, netflix uses machine learning algorithms
space, explore new territories (mars) involves using machine learning algorithms
We'll be discussing each and every application mentioned above in details in the upcomming courses.</p>
